# ISE304 Systems Simulation (2021-2022 Spring, Istinye University)
This page includes coding exercises we did in the class. You can either clone this repo to your computer (and run files directly on your MATLAB) or view them here.
* The file [`making_rvs.m`](making_rvs.m) includes MATLAB code on how we can generate various random variables, calculate any CDF values, sketch PDFs over an interval, pick random numbers, etc. It also includes a seed setting example.
* In Assignment 1, I asked students to approximate `\pi$'
