This page includes coding exercises we did in the class. You can either clone this repo to your computer (and run files directly on your MATLAB) or view them here.
* `makedist.m` includes MATLAB code on how we can generate various random variables, calculate any CDF values, sketch PDFs over an interval, pick random numbers, etc. It also includes a seed setting example
